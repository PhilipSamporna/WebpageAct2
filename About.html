                    Hello! My name is Phelip C. Samporna, and I am a 2nd year IT student who is passionate about<br>
                    learning programming. I believe that programming is one of the most important skills to<br>
                    have in the modern world, and I am dedicated to mastering it.<br>

                    <br><br>Although I am still learning, I am excited about the possibilities that programming can bring<br>
                    to the table. I enjoy tackling new challenges and pushing my boundaries to see what I am<br>
                    capable of achieving. I find that programming provides a unique opportunity to create<br>
                    omething from scratch and bring my ideas to life.<br>

                    <br><br>My interests in IT and programming are not limited to just academics. I am always looking<br>
                    for new opportunities to expand my knowledge and apply it in real-world situations. I am<br>
                    constantly exploring new technologies, attending hackathons, and participating in coding<br>
                    challenges to hone my skills.<br>

                    <br><br>My ultimate goal is to become a skilled software developer, and I believe that my<br>
                    enthusiasm, dedication, and hard work will help me achieve that goal. I am excited to see<br>
                    where my programming journey will take me, and I am committed to learning and growing<br>
                    as a programmer.<br>
